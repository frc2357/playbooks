# Mentoring

This is the collection of information for new and returning Mentors for Team 2357 System Meltdown.

The intent of this playbook is to provide resources for new and returning Mentors.

## Getting Started as a Mentor
1. Become a Ray-Pec Volunteer.  --> https://www.raypec.k12.mo.us/page/volunteering-in-ray-pec
2. Register in the FIRST System.  --> https://www.firstinspires.org/ways-to-help/volunteer/how-to-register
3. Provide an email address (preferably the one you used for the First Registration) to the Team Coach / Lead Mentor to access to Slack, Github, Google Drive, etc...
4. A few useful links are given below.  If you are totally new to FIRST, suggest checking out the [WPILIBPI Hardware Reference](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/hardware/hardware-basics/index.html) to get a general understanding of the hardware used in FIRST.
