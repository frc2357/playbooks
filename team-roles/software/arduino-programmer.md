# Arduino Programmer

We utilize the Arduino programming environment for some sensor systems on the robot, and also
some off-season or tangential programming projects.

An Arduino Programmer is familiar with core programming and object-oriented programming practices.
They can conceptualize and understand program execution flow, and general performance characteristics.

## Time Commitment

| Schedule Phase     | Effort   |
|--------------------|----------|
| Off Season         | Low      |
| Pre-Season         | Low      |
| Build Season       | Mid      |

## Qualities
 - Knowledge of basic programming, flow control, variables
 - Knowledge of Object Oriented Programming
 - Understanding of base single-threaded code performance
 - Basic electrical knowledge (ohm's law, etc.)
 - Knowledge of digital protocols such as I2C, SPI, Digial I/O, Analog Inputs, UARTs.
 - Basic soldering knowledge

## Responsibilities

### Off Season
 - Available for off-season projects or project updates, such as t-shirt cannon robot

### Pre-Season
 - Research and Development on sensors that could be used in the competition season
 - Construct base code for driving a sensor using existing USB sensor code library

### Build Season
 - Test out potential sensors to be used on the robot on prototypes or early models
 - Work with WPILib Programmers to ensure performance and accuracy of any sensors used
 - Work with CAD drafters for any housings/mounts for sensors
 - Solder together sensor assemblies and spare units
 - Assist in installation of sensors
