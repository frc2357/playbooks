# Impact Award

The FIRST Impact award is an important part of our competition season, it is an opportunity for us to show how we raise
STEM awareness in our community and beyond. Additionally, resources we produce through this process become excellent
marketing tools to be used with prospective and existing sponsors, and our community at large.

## Roles

The roles for the impact award are all part-time and are active generally during pre-kickoff and early build season,
with some work occurring just before and during competition.
