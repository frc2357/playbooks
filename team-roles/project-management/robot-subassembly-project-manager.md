# Robot Subassembly Project Manager

The Robot Subassembly Project Manager oversees the schedule and overall progress on a single robot subassembly. The time commitment for
a given subassembly depends on its schedule more than the overall build/competition schedule. For instance, a subassembly redesign may
happen between competitions, which means the effort for this role will focus on that period of time.
