# System Meltdown Team Roles

This purpose of this documentation is to list and describe every role available and needed by the team.

No single role will occupy 100% of a student's time. It's expected that each student will fill multiple
roles throughout the season.

Each year, a spreadsheet will be derived from this list to allocate students to those roles and
highlight needs for student training and recruitment, and finally to show the gaps in our team that mentors
and other students will need to fill. At this time, we're focusing on the roles needed for the FRC season,
but off-season roles can be added at a later date.
