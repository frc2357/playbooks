# Pit Crew Chief

The Pit Crew Chief is responsible for pit crew operation and is the authority for the proper operation
of the Robot. If there's an issue with the Robot, it's ultimately the Pit Crew Chief's call on how to
address it, fixing it, remediating it in some other way, or delaying a fix if necessary.
