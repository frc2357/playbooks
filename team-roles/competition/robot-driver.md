# Robot Driver

The Robot Driver relies on quick reflexes and a great degree of control in order
to reduce our cycle time and drive up scoring at competition. Ideally, our driver
is not thinking about strategy during a match. We want our driver to be focused
solely on the task at hand. We refer to this mindset as "shark mode" where the driver
is focused on finding game pieces, acquiring them, and scoring them.
