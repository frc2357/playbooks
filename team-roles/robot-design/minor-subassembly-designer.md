# Minor Subassembly Designer

Occasionally, there's a mechanism that isn't as familiar to FRC. Typically these are smaller and auxiliary to the robot.
A good example is control panel manipulators from 2022.

## Time Commitment

| Schedule Phase     | Effort   |
|--------------------|----------|
| Prototyping        | High     |
| Initial Design     | High     |
| Support/Follow Up  | Mid      |

## Qualities
 - Technical knowledge of robot design
 - Base CAD abilities (sketch, extrude, measure)

## Responsibilities
 - Drive prototyping efforts from beginning to end
 - Provide motor and gearing calculations for drive mechanisms
 - Provide pressure and force calculations for pneumatic devices
 - Include cable management in the design from the beginning
 - Create geometry sketches to ensure proper critical dimensions
 - Iterate prototype from crude, hand created, to 1:1 scale wood, to using robot materials
 - Work closely with CAD Engineer and remain involved throughout CAD process with frequent check-ins
 - Coordinate with Lead Robot Designer for design considerations
 - Work with Assembly Lead and CAD Engineer to ensure assembly goes smoothly
 - Work with Project Manager, CAD Engineer, and Assembly Lead to set target dates, and check in on scheduling
