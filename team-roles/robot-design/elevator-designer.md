# Elevator Designer

An elevator is designed around fast linear motion. This motion should never rely on gravity and should be actively powered
both up and down. Movement should be snappy, fast, but controller. Elevator should be adequately rigid even at full extension.

## Time Commitment

| Schedule Phase     | Effort   |
|--------------------|----------|
| Prototyping        | High     |
| Initial Design     | High     |
| Support/Follow Up  | Mid      |

## Qualities
 - Technical knowledge of robot design
 - Base CAD abilities (sketch, extrude, measure)

## Responsibilities
 - Drive prototyping efforts from beginning to end
 - Provide motor and gearing calculations for drive mechanisms
 - Provide pressure and force calculations for pneumatic devices
 - Include cable management in the design from the beginning
 - Create geometry sketches to ensure proper critical dimensions
 - Iterate prototype from crude, hand created, to 1:1 scale wood, to using robot materials
 - Work closely with CAD Engineer and remain involved throughout CAD process with frequent check-ins
 - Coordinate with Lead Robot Designer for design considerations
 - Work with Assembly Lead and CAD Engineer to ensure assembly goes smoothly
 - Work with Project Manager, CAD Engineer, and Assembly Lead to set target dates, and check in on scheduling
