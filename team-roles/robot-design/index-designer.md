# Index Designer

The Index on a robot is what stores game pieces and transports them from the intake to the shooter or manipulator.
Both handoffs should be seamless and have no dead areas where a game piece can get stuck. Additionally, the index
should be fast enough where the shooter or manipulator isn't waiting for the next game piece.

## Time Commitment

| Schedule Phase     | Effort   |
|--------------------|----------|
| Prototyping        | High     |
| Initial Design     | High     |
| Support/Follow Up  | Mid      |

## Qualities
 - Technical knowledge of robot design
 - Base CAD abilities (sketch, extrude, measure)

## Responsibilities
 - Drive prototyping efforts from beginning to end
 - Ensure both handoffs from intake and to scoring device are seamless and have no dead zones
 - Provide motor and gearing calculations for drive mechanisms
 - Provide pressure and force calculations for pneumatic devices
 - Create geometry sketches to ensure proper critical dimensions
 - Iterate prototype from crude, hand created, to using robot materials
 - Work closely with CAD Engineer and remain involved throughout CAD process with frequent check-ins
 - Coordinate with Lead Robot Designer for design considerations
 - Work with Assembly Lead and CAD Engineer to ensure assembly goes smoothly
 - Work with Project Manager, CAD Engineer, and Assembly Lead to set target dates, and check in on scheduling
