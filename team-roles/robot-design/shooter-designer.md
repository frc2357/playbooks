# Shooter Designer

The shooter on a robot is fairly simple, but always has critical geometry.
Variables to consider are compression, speed, angle, and back/front spin

## Time Commitment

| Schedule Phase     | Effort   |
|--------------------|----------|
| Prototyping        | High     |
| Initial Design     | High     |
| Support/Follow Up  | Mid      |

## Qualities
 - Technical knowledge of robot design
 - Base CAD abilities (sketch, extrude, measure)

## Responsibilities
 - Drive prototyping efforts from beginning to end
 - Ensure the variables are well dialed in and we have high consistency and accuracy
 - Create geometry sketches to ensure proper critical dimensions
 - Iterate prototype from crude, hand created, to using robot materials
 - Work closely with CAD Engineer and remain involved throughout CAD process with frequent check-ins
 - Coordinate with Lead Robot Designer for design considerations
 - Work with Assembly Lead and CAD Engineer to ensure assembly goes smoothly
 - Work with Project Manager, CAD Engineer, and Assembly Lead to set target dates, and check in on scheduling
