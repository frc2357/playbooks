# Robot Design

Robot Design is a specialized type of mechanical/electrical/pneumatic design. FRC has its own peculiarities and set of principles that work,
so having historic knowledge and studying previous year robot designs really pays off. Robot Designers should have a fairly deep knowledge
of how FRC robots work and what sorts of mechanisms work well, and how to design for fast, precise movements with minimal slop, and how to
deal with large amounts of vibration and impact while on the field.

## Roles

Robot Design roles are very involved at the beginning of the build schedule, but then taper off as the design has been proven and the
CAD for the robot and mechanisms stabilizes. After that, minor revisions will often be needed, and even complete redesigns at times.
