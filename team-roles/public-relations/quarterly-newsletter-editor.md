# Quarterly Newsletter Editor

We endeavor to release a newsletter via email list 4 times a year. The schedule for this is roughly:

1. September: Offseason activities, recruiting, training
2. January (just after kickoff): kickoff, new game, competition dates
3. March (before competitions): Robot, competition dates, team updates
4. May (after season): Season wrap-up, team recognition

The newsletter editor sends out this email to our list of parents, sponsors, and VIPs (superintendent, school board, etc.)
