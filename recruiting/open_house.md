# Recruiting Open House

So you want to have an open house to bring in new students. Here's what you need to do:

## 0. Get list of 8th graders from middle school coaches

Contact the FLL coaches from both middle schools to get the list of 8th grade participants and any other
students they'd recommend. Make sure to ask for parent emails too!

## 1. Decide the format and schedule the date

We've had the best luck in weekday evenings for this type of meeting, starting at 6pm.
An open format where students and their families can come and go during that time seems to work well.

** Make sure to put the event on the team calendar! **

### Decide on the activities

Rotating through a couple of activities seems to work well. Here's what we've done in the past:

#### Driving the robot
Nothing beats getting hands on the controller and driving our robots.
Make sure to reduce driving speed and give each student a set amount of time.

#### Tour of the shop
Students and families enjoy seeing the different parts of the shop and what we do there.
It's a really good introduction to the team. Try to get several students doing the talking here.

#### Videos
There are some good inspirational videos that we can show to the students and their families.
We try to keep the short, for attention-span sake.

## 2. Send out invitations/announcements

1. Send a special email to the FLL students and their parents to invite them to the event. Feel free to add some more detail to this email and talk about the benefits of the FIRST program.
2. Schedule a follow-up email a couple days before the event. Include a map with directions.
3. Send an email to get the announcement put in RP Update. Keep this one short, to a single paragraph.

## 3. Prepare for the event

Depending on the activities, you'll need to arrange the shop, set up the code on the robot, set up a TV with videos, etc.

### Don't forget to put out signs to the shop
We have some vinyl cut signs with arrows to direct people to our shop.
Put one out on the corner of Peculiar Way and School Road, and the other one on School Road where you turn towards the shop.

### Create a sign-up form for each new recruit's parents to fill out
We've used a Google Form and just had a computer on a workbench for parents to use to fill out the form right there.
Make sure to collect:
- Student name
- Parents names
- Student email
- Parents emails

You can also add checkboxes for interests, etc. if you want.
