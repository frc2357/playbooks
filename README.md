# FRC 2357 System Meltdown Team Playbooks

This is the collection of playbooks for the FIRST Robotics Team 2357 System Meltdown.

For more information about our team, [click here](http://frc2357.org/).

And for more information about FIRST, [click here](https://www.firstinspires.org/).

The intent of these playbooks are to write down what we do as a team and how we do it, all the way from
the top level down to individual tasks.

Most playbooks will either be from a "what needs to be done", or "how should a task be done" context.
For a "how" playbook, a single task is laid out in clear, consise, numbered steps.
For a "what" playbook, a bullet list of everything to be done should be included, with a link to a "how" playbook for each task.
